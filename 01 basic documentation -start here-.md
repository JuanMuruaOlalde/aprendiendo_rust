# Documentation

## Basic concepts

Two books are key:

- [The Rust Lang Book - The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html)

- [The Cargo Book - The Rust Package Manager](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html)

It is very paintful to try any work without mastering these three main concepts:

- [Understanding Ownership - The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html)

- [The `Option` Enum and Its Advantages Over Null Values](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html?highlight=Option#the-option-enum-and-its-advantages-over-null-values)

- [The `Result` Enum and Error Handling in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-00-error-handling.html)

As in any other language, it is very difficult to do anything serious without using libraries:

- [Rust Crate List - Blessed.rs - an unofficial guide to the Rust ecosystem](https://blessed.rs/crates)

- [Rust Crate List - Docs.rs - the official guide to the Rust ecosystem](https://docs.rs/)

- [Rust std library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/)

## Hands-on learning

If you want to start practicing without installing anything, you can try Rust online with (https://play.rust-lang.org/). 

If you want to start serious, install `rustup` (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) and use `cargo` (https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/first-steps.html). If you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as IDE, you can use it with the [Rust.analyzer extension](https://rust-analyzer.github.io)
